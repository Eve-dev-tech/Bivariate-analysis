# Bivariate-analysis
This project covers bivariate analysis. I have learned and practiced to analyse two variables simultaneously. I have tried to determine any relationship between two variables. I have used the suicide rates (1985 t0 2016) from kaggle. 


I have covered the following ;

## Numerical vs. Numerical
1. Scatterplot
2. Line plot
3. Heatmap for correlation
4. Joint plot
## Categorical vs. Numerical
1. Bar chart
2. Violin plot
3. Categorical box plot
4. Swarm plot
## Two Categorical Variables
1. Bar chart
2. Grouped bar chart
3. Point plot


## Case Study (Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016)
The aim is to make general analysis of suicide rates.
​
I will start using the above techniques on a practical dataset. The data is about suicide rates from 1985 to 2016.
